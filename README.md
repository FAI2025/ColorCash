### About Me

I'm a passionate Game Developer with a keen interest in blockchain and Web3 technologies. I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life through code and building engaging user experiences.

Currently, I'm focused on developing a "Color-matching puzzle game where players solve increasingly complex color-based puzzles to progress through levels" color and number prediction game, inspired by titles like Wizcolor and Mantrimall, specifically designed for the **Stake platform using the Stake Engine Math SDK**.

### What I'm Working On

* ðŸŽ® **"ColorCash" Game:** Developing a provably fair prediction game with a simple yet addictive concept.
    * **Technology Stack:** Stake Engine Math SDK (Python), React, Web3.js/Ethers.js (for blockchain interaction).
    * **Key Features:** Red/Green color prediction, number betting, clear win/loss conditions, integration with Stake platform's betting mechanics.
    * **Current Progress:** Core game logic (betting, results, multipliers, Firestore records) is complete. UI/UX upgraded with premium design and animations. Next: integrate simulated Stake Engine for provably fair outcomes and explore smart contract interaction.
    * **Repository for the game:** https://github.com/FAI2025/ColorCash.git

* ðŸ’¡ Always exploring new ideas in decentralized gaming and smart contract development.
